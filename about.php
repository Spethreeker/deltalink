    <h3 class="title is-2 has-text-centered">History</h3><br>
    <p class="subtitle is-4" style="letter-spacing: .1em; font-weight: 400;">The Delta is a special place where everyone can call home. One of the main purposes for the Delta is its agriculure industry. 
      People in need for internet are miles and miles away from town where some ISPs (Internet Service Providers) cannot reach. Well, Delta Link is here to provide good quality service to those.<br>
      <br>A partnership was formed between two intelligent and creative professionals named Keith Luna and Tony Jones. With the two working together, they have managed to create this network for the Delta. 
      In 2009, Delta Link became official and began to service customers around the Delta. With many years of experience, Delta Link has improved over the years. 
    Delta Link is growing every year, so come support us, and we will support you. </p>
