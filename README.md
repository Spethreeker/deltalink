## Rules
1. If you're gonna edit CSS, don't edit bulma.css, edit stylesheet.css. If you edit bulma be sure to minimize it afterwards.
2. If you add images, run them through [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac) first. It removes metadata instead of reducing image quality and makes a difference sometimes.
